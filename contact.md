Look for me on the [Atomist community slack](https://join.atomist.com)! 

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jessitron), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1359958), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jessitron),
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jessitronica),
and my [blog](http://blog.jessitron.com).

Or, I bet you can guess my gmail address.

<u>Speaking policy</u>: I can't travel to conferences as much as I'd like,
because it takes time away from development work. For travel to Europe, it's
gotta be business class, because otherwise the travel days are lost. Of for-profit
conferences or companies, I also ask for a keynote honorarium of $5000 (negotiable).
