I'm currently writing Clojure for [Outpace](http://outpace.com/), where all developers
work remotely. Before that, I loved writing Scala at Monsanto in St. Louis, MO. Most of my experience is in Java, and I find that trying new languages leads to better code even in well-known languages.

Find me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1359958), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jessitron), and my [blog](http://blog.jessitron.com).

Or, I bet you can guess my gmail address.
