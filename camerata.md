People often ask me after seeing my talk about the Florentine Camerata: how can I form a Camerata? I'll collect resources here.

But first, there's something you should know about the Florentine Camerata. They didn't call themselves by that name at the time. They didn't call themselves anything. They met informally (but regularly) in multiple places. In groups like these, there are a core of members who usually show up, plus different people who come in and out. Plus correspondents who contribute without being present.

Groups like this, like an invisible college, are also called a scene (or scenius). They share a geographic location, and sometimes a building. They are working on their own projects, and cricitizing (or commenting on) each others' work.

Suggestions for coalescing a camerata with you in it:

Examples of cameratas:

* [the Hillside Group, 1990s, with Beck and Booch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hillside_Group)
* [the Club, 1760s, with Johnson and Boswell](https://www.amazon.com/Club-Johnson-Boswell-Friends-Shaped/dp/0300217900/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=the+club+in+books&qid=1570578778&sr=8-3)

Please send your examples and suggestions to jessitron@gmail.com.
I'm sorry to all the people who gave me suggestions before I started this page.
