I'm incredibly excited to be a software developer. Especially now that I work at [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com) on automating everyone's software development.

I do some blogging, on the [Atomist blog](https://blog.atomist.com),
and [my personal blog](https://blog.jessitron.com). You can get my small thoughts with added personal remarks if you sign up for [my newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/jessitron).

and some tweeting: [@jessitron](http://twitter.com/jessitron)

and some podcasting, on [Greater than Code](http://www.greaterthancode.com) and [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/).

and live-streaming of my real programming work, on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jessitronica)

and some meetup-ing, in St. Louis

and rather a lot of speaking.
