I'm a software developer with a hobby of presenting at conferences.

My missions are to bridge the gap between object-oriented and functional
development; learn new technoligies and find the essential concepts
inside; and trigger insight in other minds.

I accomplish this through [presenting](talks.html), [blogging](http://blog.jessitron.com), and [tweeting](http://twitter.com/jessitron).
