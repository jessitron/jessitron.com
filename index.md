I'm a software developer with a hobby of presenting at conferences. I like to think and to make other people think.

My missions include 

* bridging the gap between object-oriented and functional development
* learning new tech and finding the essential concepts inside
* spreading knowledge and insight

I accomplish this through [presenting](talks.html), [blogging](http://blog.jessitron.com), and [tweeting](http://twitter.com/jessitron).
