I'm incredibly excited to be a software developer. Especially now that I work at [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com) on automating everyone's software development.

I do some blogging, mostly on the [Atomist blog](https://blog.atomist.com), plus sometimes on [medium](https://medium.com/@jessitron);
older stuff is at
[abstractivate.jessitron.com](http://abstractivate.jessitron.com).

and some tweeting: [@jessitron](http://twitter.com/jessitron)

and some podcasting, on [Greater than Code](http://greaterthancode.com) and [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/).

and live-streaming of my real programming work, on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jessitronica)

and some meetup-ing, in St. Louis

and rather a lot of speaking.
