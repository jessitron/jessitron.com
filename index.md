I'm incredibly excited to be a software developer. Especially now that I work at [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com) on automating everyone's software development.

I do some blogging, mostly at https://medium.com/@jessitron ; older stuff is at
[abstractivate.jessitron.com](http://abstractivate.jessitron.com).

and some tweeting: [@jessitron](http://twitter.com/jessitron)

and some podcasting, on [&gt;Code](http://greaterthancode.com)

and some meetup-ing, in St. Louis

and some speaking.
