This is what I want on my site. Implementing it is separate.

Could we possibly be alive in a more interesting time? Growing up, the
Atari was exciting. Instead of a varsity letter jacket I chose a graphic
calculator, and programmed it to play simple games. I remember computers
before modems, the internet before Netscape. Cell phones too heavy to
carry outside the car.

And now we have software development -- a beautifully complex landscape,
a profession unlike any before, so new that we're figuring out how to do our
jobs, with so much value (and therefore money) that people pay
us to figure out how to do our jobs.

Where, if we're doing our job well, we spend most of our time learning.
Learning the domain, learning technology, and most of all: learning how
to work together.

I'm incredibly excited to be a software developer.

As such, I do some blogging:
[abstractivate.jessitron.com](http://abstractivate.jessitron.com)
and some tweeting: [@jessitron](http://twitter.com/jessitron)
and software development, at Outpace which is amazing
and some podcasting, as a panelist on Ruby Rogues
and some meetup-ing, at Lambda Lounge and STL Ruby and Java.
and some speaking.

This year's conference schedule:
3 Feb 2015, JS Remote Conf
7-8 April, Philly ETE
22-24 April, Craft Conf in Budapest
25-26 June, KCDC
2-4 July, PolyConf, Pozna≈Ñ, Poland
17-19 September, Strange Loop

Here are my talks so far:

5) Complexity is Outside the Code
Everybody does refactoring, right? We keep our code clean and expect
that to keep the complexity of our software under control. Except it
doesn't work. If our code is small enough to be simple, and especially
if we leverage other libraries and technologies to keep us productive,
the complexity shows up in other locations.
In a joint keynote with Dan North, I point out that the best we can do
is push the complexity outside the code - and suggest how we can deal
with it there.

testing mathy things, is now a strong tool for testing at the service or
module level. With fewer
tests, we can think harder, change faster, and know more about our
application.

1) Property-based Testing for Better Code
For reliable services that respond well in changing circumstances, TDD
isn't good enough. Property-based testing, long used in Haskell for
testing mathy things, is now a strong tool for testing at the service or
module level. With fewer
tests, we can think harder, change faster, and know more about our
application.

4) Concurrency Options on the JVM
Nobody uses threads and locks directly anymore. (Please, if you are,
watch this talk.) Instead, we have a plethora of abstractions. Akka
actors, Clojure core.async, Java 8 streams -- they're all beautiful in
their different ways. And none of them free us from thinking about
threads. This talk focuses on the commonalities between high-level
concurrency abstractions, and what you didn't want to have to know, but
should, about the JVM mechanics underneath them.

1) Git Happens
If you are ever frustrated by version control, this talk is for you.
Learn why git matters and how to speak its language.

I've delivered this talk many times. My favorite is still the first.
Here's a site with related links: Git Happens
I also do on-site workshops, in case your company is struggling with the
switch to git. A few hours of insight can turn pain into pride.

2) Functional Principles for Object-Oriented Developers
If you work in an object-oriented language, you can still benefit from
the functional programming craze. Learn the important parts of FP,
parts you can use any day in any language.

Here's the easiest-to-watch version of this talk: KCDC 2014

and here's my favorite delivery, but they didn't incorporate the slides:
GOTO Chicago 2014, and the slides

and here's a Ruby-specific version.

3) Object-Oriented Design in the Wild
When you're really good at OOD, how much of that transfers to languages
other than Java or C#? This talk looks at how to use OO
principles in languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and Haskell. This gets at
the essence of the principles themselves, and that essence can help us
get even better at programming in our native language.

Unfortunately no one has published a video of this one. Invite me to do
this one at your conference.
Slides are here, but that won't help you much.
