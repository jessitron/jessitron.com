Data these days: there's a crapton of it, and a lot of it is crap. We
need efficiency, we need resource management, and we need to react to
surprises. Can we get just-in-time processing AND secure error handling
AND a modular flexibility like OO has never seen? Welcome to a new world
of data streaming. You want multiple sources? You want asynchronous,
isolated I/O? You want on-the-fly decisions? We have it all! This talk
introduces reactive data processing in Scala. See code that modifies its
flow at runtime. Scalaz streams (emphasis on the zed) showcases Scala's
confluence of OO+FP with a productively lazy, reassuringly safe, purely
functional style. And modularity! I think code re-use is overrated,
except like this. In this session, be on the watch for advanced
functional programming patterns disguised in ordinary English. You may
never think about richly decadent type systems the same way again.
