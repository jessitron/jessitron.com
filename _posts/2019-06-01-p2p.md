Current abstract:

What will help you grow as a developer, skills or understanding?
Which internal software has negative business value?
When does correctness matter?
Oh, and - can software save the world?

Jessica looks to her own career and to the history of Cybernetics for answers -- or better, more interesting questions.

Follow her through solving puzzles to growing products and beyond. From Cold War rationality back to Enlightenment reason.
Learn new ways to think about your career in software and a new way to talk about your systems.
