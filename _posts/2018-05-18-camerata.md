(Formerly titled "On the Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming")

There's a story to tell, about musicians, artists, philosophers, scientists, and then programmers.

There's a truth inside it that leads to a new view of work, that sees beauty in the painful complexity that is software development.

Starting from The Journal of the History of Ideas, Jessica traces the concept of an “invisible college” through music and art and science to programming. She finds the dark truth behind the 10x developer, a real definition of “Senior Developer” and a new name for our work and our teams.
