This opening keynote addressed why learning a language like Scala can be hard, and how we can all make it better.

Scala is a scalable language. It is scalable in the computer sense, of small programs building into large programs. Does it scale in our mind, as well? There are a lot of ideas expressed in Scala. How do we scale those ideas from conception into full use? For any given idea, one person can't do it alone. There is room in the Scala community for all of us, and a need for all of us. Together, we can scale the language into bigger ideas, into a bigger community, and together realize our own potential and the language's.
