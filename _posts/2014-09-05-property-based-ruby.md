What’s better than Test-Driven Development? Even more test driven
development - this time with deeper tests. Can we approach
mathematical proof without ballooning the lines of test code we
maintain? This is the goal of Generative Testing.
This kind of test is much harder to write, and that’s the best reason to do it. Thinking
before coding is the real purpose of TDD, and generative testing drives
us to think harder.
