This keynote compares software innovation to progress in scientific discoveries. Both are the product of many people over time, a product of teaching the people behind us so that they can go farther than we could. 

Slides and narration are documented in [this PDF](https://github.com/jessitron/jessitron.com/raw/gh-pages/files/Elixir.pdf).
