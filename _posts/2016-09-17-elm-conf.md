In which Jessitron introduces Atomist:

I love the explicitness and structure of Elm. I don’t love typing.

A mechanical friend can help with both: smart templates modify code to perform common tasks, and Github PRs keep this safe and editor-independent.

See an Elm project created and grown with strategically placed automation.

I love the explicitness and the consistent structure of Elm code and the Elm Architecture. Sometimes I don’t love the typing involved.

Elm is well-suited to code generation. We like to generate code (like with html2elm) and modify it. The automation doesn’t have to end there!

This session will demonstrate growing an Elm app with the help of a smarter templating engine and Github pull requests. Tasks like “add a new component” or “start using elm-test” or “change a service contract” happen safely and mechanically, outside of your favorite editor.

Keep all the structure, skip some of the tedium. See another reason that Elm can be our most productive language system yet.
