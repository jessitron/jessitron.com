Our job as software developers is harder than it used to be. There's so much to learn: always new tech, plus now we are supposed to do operations and also understand the business and do our own testing.

Yet, our job is also better - for these same reasons!

This wasn't recorded and was a unique talk. You had to be there. The Pokemon analogies were great, trust me.
