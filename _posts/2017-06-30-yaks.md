Programming is a series of frustrations. Everything we do, we could do better or faster if we only had our tools set up just so. If our error messages were a little better, our code a little cleaner, our tests a lot wider. How do you balance the work you’re supposed to be doing with the work that makes your work, work? Dive into the yak stack with me. I’ll get bored with writing code, and write code to write code for me, and then write code to make that easier. Somewhere down here is the golden yak, the one with secret wisdom engraved on its skin.

This session will give you reasons to spend time smoothing your development experience, and clues for where to spend that time in ways that help your whole team.
