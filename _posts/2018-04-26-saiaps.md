I spent years as a Java developer, then years gobbling up languages like Scala, F#, Clojure, Elm, and Ruby. Some days I long for the simplicity of one language. How can we have the best of both worlds: flexibility and exploration, without the productivity hit? Jessitron has an answer (hint: it involves even more code).

This talk was implemented in microsessions, grouped in a [GitHub org](https://github.com/saiaps/). Find all the materials here: [wiki](https://github.com/saiaps/internal-docs/wiki).
