Guava is a Java library from Google full of elegant solutions to common problems. From a simple null check to a thread-safe self-populating cache, Guava has something for everyone. This easy-to-include, carefully-designed library gives you true immutable collections, declarative lazy-evaluating list processing, a better event handling pattern -- a veritable grab bag of handy Java tricks. Take a quick tour of what Guava offers, with special focus on caching and list processing. Even if Guava is already in your project dependencies, you'll be surprised at all the juicy goodness inside.
