As software grows, we look for new ways to break it into parts and then
hook the parts together. Functional programming is about new ways to
isolate and then integrate code. Learn principles behind the trappings
of functional programming. React embodies some of these principles — and
can embody all of them, if we use it carefully. See how we are
untangling the spaghetti of MVC, first with React, then Flux, then Elm.
Find out how you’re already following functional principles, and how you
can choose to benefit even more.
