Everybody does refactoring, right? We keep our code clean and expect
that to keep the complexity of our software under control. Except it
doesn't work. If our code is small enough to be simple, and especially
if we leverage other libraries and technologies to keep us productive,
the complexity shows up in other locations.
In a joint keynote with Dan North, I point out that the best we can do
is push the complexity outside the code - and suggest how we can deal
with it there.
