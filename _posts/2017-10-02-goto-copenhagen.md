Want to get better at your job?
It isn't enough to keep going. We need to move faster and -- even more important --
in the right direction. Since the "right" direction is constantly shifting, we need new strategies for acceleration.

As a programmer, we do something new every day. How do we get better at doing new things?

In this session, Jessica has answers both code-based and human-based. Along the way,
you'll find out:

  * Which programming language is the best?
  * What is "done"?
  * and, Why is software development so hard?

Come to this talk if you want to shift how you think about your job, and possibly life.
