So you consider yourself an Object Oriented developer? Don’t limit
yourself! See what functional programming can do for Ruby. Learn the
“why” behind functional programming, and how the same considerations can
help OO code. Some of these principles you already use; some express
patterns old and new; all give us different ways of thinking about
problems. Developers without expertise in functional programming will
find new techniques for thinking and coding in Ruby.
