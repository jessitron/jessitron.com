 You're a great OO developer. Can you use this skill to conquer
 JavaScript or Haskell or Ruby?
  There are truths about C# and Java that don't export, but other
  principles are universal. Dig into the reasoning behind
  object-oriented design principles, and find their application in the
  wider world. Come see how to apply skills you already have to
  languages you don't yet know. This session will challenge you to go
  beyond rules and standards and ask, when is clean code worth your
  time? Go beyond OO and come back with new insight. You'll go back to
  work on Monday with some hard questions to challenge your team.
