Let's face it: DVCS is here to stay. But what's the point? There's a million tutorials on the internet that tell you what to type in Git, but not why! Go one level deeper: A few straightforward concepts and some pictures, and git will magically make sense. Learn how to use DVCS to tell the story of your project. You'll get the point of all those extra steps in committing and updating; erase some Subversion-related preconceptions; and grasp the purpose of fast-forward merge, cherry-pick, and rebase.
