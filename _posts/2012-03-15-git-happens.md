Git: it's all the rage in source control. You may use it,
but do you understand it? There are a million tutorials out there to
tell you what to type, but not why. This talk will show you in
pictures what's going on behind the scenes in git. Those esoteric
spells you've been typing will make sense, and you'll know how to
untangle your commit history when you get your repo in a knot.
