Great automation doesn't replace humans; it enhances us. The tools we choose or build for our team need to play like team members: keep us informed, do the consistent boring work, and pass the hard decisions to the humans along with the information we need to make them.

Based on research in human-centered design, this talk enumerates principles and challenges of collaboration for programs. It lists strategies for moving past "human error" and reducing human frustration. Our tools should make us smarter, not hide knowledge from us. In aviation and medicine, this is a million-dollar investment--but when we construct our own tools, collaborative automation is within our reach.
