Organizations currently using subversion or TFS for version control find
challenges switching to git. The concepts are different enough to
instill confusion. Familiar words like checkout and commit no longer
have the same meaning, while unfamiliar words like index and tree and
rebase fill the documentation.

When I started using git, I spent twenty minutes here and there in a
state of great frustration, searching the web for how to accomplish a
task like moving a commit to a branch, or what to do about detached HEAD
state. A few hours of dedicated time, studying the underlying concepts
and vocabulary, fixed all that.

As a team, there's more to using git: there are many workflows to choose
from. Best practices for git aren't fully established, and the right
answer varies by circumstance.

If you're ready to make the switch and make it right, to be productive
in a system that lets you track work in greater detail, collaborate more
extensively, and save work with greater frequency, then I can help.

My recommendation is a two-step program of ingitiation:

<div class="callout">
  <h3>1: Leader Workshop</h3>

  <p>For one afternoon, the team leads and infrastructure experts get
    together to learn the ins and outs of git. In three hours I teach
    the vocabulary, concepts, and common pitfalls. That provides a basis
    for the most important part: workflow alternatives. We will discuss
    several alternatives in the context of your team&#39;s needs, and decide
    which practices fit the organization.</p>

  <p>Time: 4 hours<br>
  People: up to 10<br>

  </p>

  <h3>2: Developer Workshop</h3>

  <p>A few weeks later, I return to teach git concepts to the entire
    team, providing the basic vocabulary and concepts. They&#39;ll learn
    about git, and then they&#39;ll learn how to use it at your company.
    Teaching the agreed-upon workflow will make git relatively easy to
    learn and use, and a customized cheat-sheet will provide a handy
    reference. In two concentrated hours, team members will save weeks of
    frustration.</p>

  <p>Time: 2-3 hours<br>
  People: up to 20</p>

If you're in St. Louis, you can have your own two-workshop customized
series for $2000. Outside of St. Louis, we can talk, but it'll probably
cost twice that plus travel expenses.
